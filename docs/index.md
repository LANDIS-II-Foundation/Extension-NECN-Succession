# What is the NECN Succession Extension?

The NECN Succession extension was designed to provide total ecosystem accounting of Carbon and Nitrogen and to allow species to respond dynamically to a changing climate via establishment and growth.  NECN calculates how cohorts grow, reproduce, age, and die.  Dead biomass is tracked over time, divided into four pools:  surface wood, soil wood (dead coarse roots), surface litter (dead leaves), and soil litter (dead fine roots).  In addition, three principle soil pools:  fast (soil organic matter (SOM) 1), slow (SOM2), and passive (SOM3) are simulated, following the Century soil model.

# Features

- [x] New with v6.7 - simulates grass species and their interactions with regeneration!
- [x] Estimate Net Ecosystem Exchange.
- [x] Estimate Actual and Potential Evapotranspiration, Climatic Water Deficit, and Available Soil Water.
- [x] Estimate smoke emissions from wildfires and prescribed fires.
- [x] Species parameters input as CSV delimited files.
- [x] Estimate Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Nitrogen, Nitrogen fluxes

# Requirements

To use NECN, you need:

- The [LANDIS-II model v7.0](http://www.landis-ii.org/install) installed on your computer.
- Example files (see below)

# Download

The latest version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-NECN-Succession/blob/master/deploy/installer/LANDIS-II-V7%20NECN%20Succession%206.9-setup.exe). To install it on your computer, just launch the installer.

# Example Files

LANDIS-II requires a global parameter file for your scenario, and then different parameter files for each extension.

Landscape example files are [here](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-NECN-Succession/tree/master/testing/Core7-NECN6.8).

Single-cell example files are [here](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-NECN-Succession/tree/master/testing/Core7-NECN6.9-SingleCell).


# Support
