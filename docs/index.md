# What is the NECN Succession Extension?

The NECN Succession extension was designed to provide total ecosystem accounting of Carbon and Nitrogen and to allow species to respond dynamically to a changing climate via establishment and growth.  NECN calculates how cohorts grow, reproduce, age, and die.  Dead biomass is tracked over time, divided into four pools:  surface wood, soil wood (dead coarse roots), surface litter (dead leaves), and soil litter (dead fine roots).  In addition, three principle soil pools:  fast (soil organic matter (SOM) 1), slow (SOM2), and passive (SOM3) are simulated, following the Century soil model.

# Recent Additions

- [x] New with v8
  - [ ] Species and Functional Group tables have been merged
- [x] New with v7
  - [ ] Integrated drought mortality via an optional table that defines statistical relationships
  - [ ] Updated soil water algorithms that improves low moisture estimates
  - [ ] New continuous function for estimating regeneration, given light, that requires fewer parameters
  - [ ] Optionally capacity to modify PET according to topography
  - [ ] Establishment can now optionally be reduced according to climatic water deficit and/or soil drainage
  - [ ] Growth as a function of soil water now has an optional functional form that is more flexible, better able to account for wet soils
- [x] New with v6.7 - simulates grass species and their interactions with regeneration.

# Requirements

To use NECN, you need:

- The [LANDIS-II model v8.0](http://www.landis-ii.org/install) installed on your computer.
- Example files (see below)

# Download and Install the Extension

- The latest version can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-NECN-Succession/blob/master/deploy/installer/LANDIS-II-V8%20NECN%20Succession%208.0.2-setup.exe). (Look for the download icon in the upper right corner.) 
- Launch the installer.

# Example Files

LANDIS-II requires a global parameter file for your scenario, and then different parameter files for each extension.

Landscape example files are [here](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-NECN-Succession/tree/master/testing/Core8-NECN8-Landscape).

Single-cell example files are [here](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-NECN-Succession/tree/master/testing/Core8-NECN8-SingleCell).
