Time,Year (note year 0 are conditions before simulations begin and should not be included in any analysis)
 Ecoregion,A homogenous area of the landscape in regards to soils and climate
Species,The species or functional group for which the probability of establishment is being calculated.
 TempMult,"Temperature multiplier, derived from Botkin's 1972 parabolic curve.  Value determined by minimum/maximum Growing Degree Days."
 MinJanTempMult,Minimum January Temperature multiplier.  Derived from LINKAGES.  Determined by Min January Temp.
 SoilMoistureMult,Soil moisture multiplier derived from LINKAGES.  Determined by drought tolerance.
OtherAdjustMult,"Other extensions can also adjust Pest.  If so, the values (but not the source) will be listed here."
 ProbEst,"The minimum of all multipliers.  The probability of establishment is calculated N times, where N is the succession timestep.  The average of these N probabilities is used."
